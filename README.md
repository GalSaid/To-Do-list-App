1. Add a new task- in the title, write the name of the task. In the message box write additional comments (optional) and then click the save button. The task is added to the list of tasks that appear on the right side. <br /> <br />
2. Reading an existing note - clicking on the note we want to read and then on the read button. <br /> <br />
3. Opening a new note - click on the new button. <br /> <br />
4. Editing an existing note - clicking on the note, read and then after the note is opened you can edit it and click save when finished. <br /> <br />
5. Deleting tasks - Mark the tasks you want to delete by clicking them and then clicking on delete. <br /> <br /> <br />

<em><strong>Note:</strong><em> I handled edge cases such as preventing the possibility of adding an assignment without a name (title) or reading multiple tasks at the same time.
